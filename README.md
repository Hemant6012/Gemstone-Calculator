Create an Online Lucky Gemstone Identifier Tool that follows the rules of [Vedic Astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_astrology), simply by following the below-written instructions:

1. Open Your Device.
2. Now go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) through any browser or use its application, which is available on many app stores.
3. Write a prompt like this:  
   `GENERATE A ONLINE TOOL WEBPAGE USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT CALLED LUCKY GEMSTONE IDENTIFIER.`
4. ChatGPT will give you the code. You can ask it to improve and make changes as per your desire and requirement.
5. Host the webpage code through any hosting service. Some are paid, and some are free. Blogger is a free platform where you can easily host it by pasting the webpage code in the theme section.
